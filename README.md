Temperature Converter project with full SDLC documentation.
# SEN 201: Temperature Converter Project

## 1. Requirement Analysis (Planning)
The objective of this project is to create a Python application that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. This fulfills the requirements for the SEN 201 Assignment to implement a project and explain its SDLC.

 2. Design (Nomenclature)
In this phase, specific variable names were chosen to be used consistently throughout the project.
celsius_input: Used to store the numerical value entered by the user.
* **fahrenheit_result**: Used to store the result of the conversion formula.

## 3. Implementation (Coding)
The project is implemented in Python. 
NOTE:As per the assignment instructions, the names and nomenclatures used in this design match the implementation exactly.
- The variable `celsius_input` is used to capture the `float` input.
- The variable `fahrenheit_result` is used for the calculation: `(celsius_input * 9/5) + 32`.

## 4. Testing
The following test cases were used to verify the software:
* **Input**: 0 | **Expected Output**: 32.0 (Success)
* **Input**: 100 | **Expected Output**: 212.0 (Success)

## 5. Deployment
The final code (`temperature_converter.py`) and this documentation are pushed to this GitHub repository as required by the SEN 201 Task.
